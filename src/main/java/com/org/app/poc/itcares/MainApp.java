 * Make the application executable
Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional WAR file for deployment 
to an external application server, 
the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. 
You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, 
driven by a good old Java main() method. Along the way, 
you use Springâ€™s support for embedding the Tomcat servlet container as the HTTP runtime, 
instead of deploying to an external instance.
